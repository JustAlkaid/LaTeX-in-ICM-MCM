\section{Actual Battery}
    \subsection{Assumptions}
        An actual battery is much more complex than the idealized model presented in the previous section. In this section, we will consider more factors
        that affect the performance and behavior of real batteries:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Temperature}: The performance of a battery can vary significantly with temperature. At low temperatures, the internal resistance
                                        increases, leading to reduced capacity and power output. Conversely, high temperatures can enhance performance but
                                        may also accelerate degradation.
            \item \textbf{Complex Power Profile}: Real batteries often experience varying power demands, which can affect their efficiency and lifespan.
                                                  High performance demands can lead to increased heat generation, which int turns affect battery 
                                                  temperature.
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Temperature Behavior of Battery}
        Actual battery behavior is significantly influenced by temperature variations. The most common parameter affected by temperature is the internal 
        resistance. Using the Arrhenius equation, we can model the temperature dependence of internal resistance as follows:
        \begin{equation}
            R(T) = R_0 \cdot e^{ - \dfrac{E_a}{R_u}(\dfrac{1}{T} - \dfrac{1}{T_0})}
        \end{equation}
        where $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R_u$ is the universal gas constant and $T_0$ is a reference temperature.
